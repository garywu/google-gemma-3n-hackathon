## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Do NOT

- Do not open a public issue
- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

### Do

1. **Email the security team** at security@example.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

2. **Include details**:
   - Affected versions
   - Components involved
   - Proof of concept (if applicable)

3. **Be patient**:
   - We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
   - We will provide regular updates on progress
   - We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- All code is reviewed before merge
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Static code analysis tools

### Development Practices

- Secure coding guidelines followed
- Sensitive data never committed
- Environment variables for secrets
- Regular security audits

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Vulnerability scanning with:
  - Dependabot
  - Trivy
  - npm audit / pip audit
- Lock files for reproducible builds

## Security Checklist for Contributors

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Assess the scope
   - Preserve evidence

2. **Communication**:
   - Notify maintainers
   - Prepare disclosure timeline
   - Draft security advisory

3. **Resolution**:
   - Develop and test fix
   - Release patch
   - Update documentation

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct review
   - Update procedures
   - Share lessons learned

## Security Tools

Recommended security tools:

### Static Analysis
- **Python**: bandit, safety
- **JavaScript**: ESLint security plugins
- **General**: Semgrep, SonarQube

### Dependency Scanning
- GitHub Dependabot
- Snyk
- OWASP Dependency Check

### Container Scanning
- Trivy
- Clair
- Anchore

### Secret Scanning
- GitLeaks
- TruffleHog
- detect-secrets

## Best Practices

### Secrets Management
- Use environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use secret management tools
- Rotate credentials regularly

### Authentication
- Use strong password policies
- Implement MFA where possible
- Use OAuth/SAML for SSO
- Session timeout implementation

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest
- Use TLS for data in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backups with encryption

### Logging and Monitoring
- Log security events
- Monitor for anomalies
- Set up alerts
- Regular log reviews
